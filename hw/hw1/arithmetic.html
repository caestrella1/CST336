            <h1>Arithmetic</h1>
            <p>Just like decimal numbers, binary numbers can also be added and
            subtracted. For simplicity, we will only cover how to add them.</p>
            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <p>To the right, we are going to be adding the binary numbers 
                    <code>10110</code> (22) and <code>1101</code> (13). Just like
                    base-10 addition, we will start from the right side of
                    the number and find the sum at each position.</p>
                    
                    <p>To our right, we start by finding the sum of 0 and 1, which 
                    is simply 1. Moving one place to the left, we have 1 and 0, which
                    is also 1.</p>
                    
                    <p>Next, we have 1 and 1, which is 2 (or 10 in binary). Because 
                    binary is represented only with 0's and 1's, we cannot simply 
                    write a 2 here, the same way we don't write a 10 when adding 
                    decimals. Instead, we carry a 1 over to the next column and
                    continue, where we get the same scenario again, and again in the 
                    next.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our final answer is now <code>100011</code> (35).</p>
